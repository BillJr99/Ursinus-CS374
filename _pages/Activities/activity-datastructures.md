excerpt: "CS374: Programming Language Principles - Data Structures"

  goals: 
    - To explain data types from a record perspective
    - To explain data types from a tuple perspective

      title: Generics
      questions:
        - "If the language supports coercion or casting, this might not seem useful at first glance.  In what circumstances might this be a useful construct?"
        - "Consider the C library function <code>void qsort(void *base, size_t nitems, size_t size, int (*compar)(const void *, const void*))</code>.  How might you sort an array of <code>int</code>, or an array of <code>char*</code>, using this same function?"

        (define x (list 0))

      title: Tuple Linked Lists and Data Structures
      questions:
        - "What, in an abstract sense, is a linked list (regardless of its implementation in a particular programming language)?"
        - "What is a data structure in Scheme?"

      title: COBOL Records
      questions:
        - "What, in your own words, is a data structure in COBOL?"

      title: "Type Erasure"
      questions:
        - "Suppose you call <code>public static <T> max(T a, T b)</code> with two <code>Integer</code> objects.  To what type will T resolve?"
        - "Now suppose you call <code>public static <T> max(T a, T b)</code> with one <code>Integer</code> object and one <code>BigInteger</code> object (where <code>BigInteger</code> extends <code>Integer</code>).  To what type will T resolve?"
        - "In Java, how might these resolve if the two objects have nothing in common in their class hierarchy?"
        - "Might this resolution occur at compile time or at runtime?  How would this work in each situation?"
        - "Can you think of other examples where type erasure is used commonly in your favorite programming language?"
