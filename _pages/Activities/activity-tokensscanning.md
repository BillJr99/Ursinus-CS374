title: "CS374: Programming Language Principles - Tokens and Scanning Lexemes"


info: 
  goals: 
    - To define a lexeme and to define tokens based on lexemes
    - To differentiate between types, reserved words, and identifiers in a scanner
    - To read a file and identify defined tokens

      title: Scanning Lexemes for Tokens with flex
      questions:
        - "What is a lexeme?  What is a token?"
        - "Describe an algorithm to read a <code>String</code> from left to right, returning tokens as they are identified.  What familiar programming construct or paradigm do you see (hint - look at the loop, conditional, and check for the current character!)?"
        - "How would you modify this scanner configuration to support an assignment operator and an identifier (variable) token?"
        - "Notice the actual text of the token is not typically returned directly by the scanner.  Rather, it is stored in a variable (here, <code>yylval</code>).  What is returned instead, and why not simply return <code>yytext</code> directly?"
        - "Sketch the symbol table for the lexemes above.  For each token type, assign a constant value to the type, and describe the type and format of the resulting token value."
