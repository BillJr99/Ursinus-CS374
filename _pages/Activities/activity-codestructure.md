excerpt: "CS374: Programming Language Principles - Code Structure"

info: 
  goals: 
    - To explain the programming language constructs of expressions
    - To explain the programming language constructs of conditionals
    - To explain the programming language constructs of functions
    - To explain the programming language constructs of exceptions
    - To relate complex data structures to their position in memory and pointer- or reference-based representation in memory
  models:
    - model: |
        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
        int x = 5;
        
        x = x + 1;
        
        if(x == 6) {
            x = printf("%d\n", x); // is this legal?  
        }
        
        // x + 1 = x;
        ]]></script> 
      title: Assignment Expressions
      questions:
        - "In what contexts do you see <code>x</code> being used in this program?  How about the equals sign?"
        - "Why is there a <code>=</code> in some instances but a <code>==</code> in others?  What would happen if the <code>x == 6</code> were replaced with <code>x = 6</code>?  How does this compare to other languages?"
        - "Which <code>x</code> variable uses would be referred to as l-vals, and which as r-vals?"
    - model: |
        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
        int[] heights = {48, 42, 65, 58};
        
        int& height(int i) {

        }
        
        int main() {
            height(1) = 44; // person 1 grew!  Is this legal?
        }
        ]]></script> 
      title: "l-val and r-val Semantics"
      questions:
        - "In what contexts is heights an l-val, and in which is it an r-val?"
        - "What does the ampersand mean in this program?"

        }
        ]]></script> 
      title: "Conditionals"
      questions:
        - "Rewrite this code using only <code>GOTO</code> statements for the body of the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> clauses, like in BASIC."
        - "Which structure do you prefer and why?"

        ]]></script> 
      title: "Iteration"
      questions:
        - "Re-write this loop with a traditional counter loop.  How might this work using <code>GOTO</code> structures?"

      title: "Functions and Evaluation Strategies"
      questions:
        - "In C, what would happen if ptr is NULL?  Would this program fail?"
        - "From context, what do you think lazy evaluation means?"
        - "Would this outcome be different in an eager evaluation language?"
