excerpt: "CS374: Programming Language Principles - Finite Automata"

info: 
  goals: 
    - To define a finite state machine 
    - To relate a finite state machine to the grammar definition of a programming language
  models:
    - model: |
        <code>[AB]*ABAB</code>
      title: Finite Automata
      questions:
        - "Design a flow chart that reads one character at a time until the sequence <code>ABAB</code> is found."
        - "Using the FSM Designer, draw a finite state machine that accepts the strings in the given by the regular language."
        - "Using the FSM simulator, implement the finte state machine to check and accept the appropriate strings in this language."
        - "Can you determine how many extraneous A and B characters were seen before reaching the accepting state?  If not, what additional information would be needed to do so?"
        - "How does a finite state machine relate to a regular expression?"
        - "What do finite automata have to do with programming languages?  Specifically, how can they help us to connect syntax with semantics?"
