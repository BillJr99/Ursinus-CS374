      questions:
        - "What lines do you think are matched by each of the regular expressions?"
        - "How would you modify the phone number matching regular expression to allow an optional space in-between the area code and phone number?"

      questions:
        - "What pattern of A and B would take one from Shipwreck Bay to Treasure Island?"
        - "What regular expression automatically checks that a series of navigational guesses would lead from Shipwreck Bay to Treasure Island?  Note that <code>[AB]</code> means to match either character A or B once."
        - "Suppose one of the islands is a &quot;trap&quote;, such that once you enter, you can never leave.  How might you change the the flowchart to enforce this?"
