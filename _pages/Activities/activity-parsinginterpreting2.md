excerpt: "CS374: Programming Language Principles - Parsers and Interpreters"

  prev: ./ParserInterpreter
  next: ./ParserInterpreter3
  goals: 
    - To explain the limitations of an LL(1) parser
    - To remove left recursion and to left factor a grammar for LL(1) parsing, where possible
  models:
    - model: |
        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
        S -> aS 
        S -> aaS
        ]]></script>
      title: Limitations of LL(1) parsers: unique first productions and left factoring
      questions:
        - "Consider each nonterminal as a function call in a recursive descent parser.  Why is this grammar difficult to parse with an LL(1) parser?"
        - "How might we fix this grammar?"
        - "Draw a state machine representing the parse rules of this grammar, and describe the limitations in terms of the state machine."
    - model: |
        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
        S -> Ax
        A -> By
        B -> Az
        ]]></script>

      title: "An Alternative Grammar"
      questions:
        - "What is different about this grammar from the original one?"
