  goals: 
    - To explain the role of syntax in a programming language
    - To differentiate between syntax and semantics

      title: "Semiotics: Signs and Symbols"
      questions:
        - "What word arrangements can you identify in this passage, or in general prose?"
        - "What are the general phrase structures that you can see?"
        - "What are the words of this language?"
        - "How about the musical notation?  What words, phrases, and structures are evident?"

      title: Semantics
      questions:
        - "What is the subject, verb, and direct object of the first sentence?"
        - "What is the subject and verb of the second sentence?  Is there a direct object?"

        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {

      title: Semantics in Programming
      questions:
        - "What is the general syntax of a variable declartaion?"
        - "What is the type of each variable in this program?  Is this idea part of the syntax or at a higher level of abstraction?  How does this relate to seeing a note on a music sheet versus playing a sound at a particular frequency?"
        - "What is the tax rate for a person age 20 with an income of 20000?  What should it be?"
        - "What type should <code>taxamount</code> be? How do you know?"
