excerpt: "CS374: Programming Language Principles - Abstract Syntax Trees"

info: 
  goals: 
    - To define an Abstract Syntax Tree for a given grammar
    - To augment grammars with attribute grammars
  models:
    - model: |

        ]]></script>
      title: Attribute Grammars
      questions:
        - "Where do you think inherited attributes might come from?"
        - "What are some other attributes you might associate with productions?"
        - "Suppose an Expression is the product of a Term and a Factor.  How might you determine the type (<code>float</code> or <code>int</code>) of the resulting Expression?"

      title: "Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)"
      questions:
        - "In what ways is this simpler than a full parse tree?  What items are retained, and which are omitted?"
