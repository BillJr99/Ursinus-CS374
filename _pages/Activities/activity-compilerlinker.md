excerpt: "CS374: Programming Language Principles - The Compilation and Linking Processes"

info: 
  goals: 
    - To describe the compilation process
    - To define an algorithm to resolve linker dependencies using a multi-pass approach
    - To define possible outcomes of the compilation process, including assembly code, machine code, and intermediate bytecode
    - To describe the role of external libraries in extending the functionality of a programming language and the mechanisms for integrating them

      title: Linker Processes
      questions:
        - "Assume that we compile with <code>gcc file1.c file2.c</code>.  What does the compiler have to do with the variable <code>x</code> in <code>file1.c</code>, since it does not yet know here the variable is declared?"
        - "With what is the variable <code>x</code> updated in <code>file1.c</code> once it can resolve it to <code>int x</code> in <code>file2.c</code>?"
        - "What does the assignment in <code>a()</code> do to the variable in <code>file2.c</code>?"
        - "What if there was a variable in <code>file2.c</code> called <code>a</code>?"
        - "What would happen if the variable <code>x</code> in <code>file1.c</code> was also initialized to a value when it was first declared?"
        - "Under what circumstances do you think a variable is bound to a global, versus a linker error?"
        - "In the C language, what do you think the <code>static</code> keyword does?  How can we use this to protect global variables inside externally linked library functions?"
