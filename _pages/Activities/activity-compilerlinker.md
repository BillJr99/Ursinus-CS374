  goals: 
    - To describe the compilation process
    - To define an algorithm to resolve linker dependencies using a multi-pass approach
    - To define possible outcomes of the compilation process, including assembly code, machine code, and intermediate bytecode
    - To describe the role of external libraries in extending the functionality of a programming language and the mechanisms for integrating them
