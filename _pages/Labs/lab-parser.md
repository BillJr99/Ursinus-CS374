The purpose of this labs is to implement a recursive descent parser for a simple LL(1) parser, and then to define a lex and yacc parser to create and parse according to a parse table.

## Part 1: Recursive Descent Parser

Consider our recursive descent parser for the following grammar:

```
expr: term addsub expr
    | term
term: factor muldiv term
    | factor
factor: num
      | "(" expr ")"
addsub: "+" | "-"
muldiv: "*" | "/"
num: [0-9]+
```

Which we implemented as follows \[[^1]\] \[[^2]\]:

### calc.c

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int expr(void);
char token;

// remove the next character from the stream
char pop() {
    char ch = getchar();
    printf("Popped %c\n", ch);
    return ch;
}

// check the next character, but don't remove it from the stream
char peek() {
    char ch = pop();
    ungetc(ch, stdin);
    printf("Pushed %c\n", ch);
    return ch;
}

int readint() {
    int numchars = 0;
    char* val = (char*) malloc(1); // for the trailing \0
    
    token = peek();
    while(isdigit(token)) {
        pop(); 
        
        numchars = numchars + 1;
        val = (char*) realloc(val, numchars + 1); // for the trailing \0
        
        val[numchars-1] = token;
        
        token = peek();
    }
    
    val[numchars] = '\0'; // null terminate
    
    int result = atoi(val);
    
    printf("Read int from string %s (length %d): %d\n", val, strlen(val), result);
    
    free(val);
    
    return result;
}

int factor(void) {
    printf("In factor\n");
    
    int value;
    token = peek();

    if (token == '(') { // resolve parens as a whole new expression, resolving to a value, regardless of where they occur in the input (since they are highest precedence)
        pop(); // (
        value = expr();
        token = pop(); // )

        if(token != ')') {
            printf("Error parsing factor, imbalanced parenthesis\n");
            exit(-1);
        }
    } else if (isdigit(token)) {
        value = readint();
    } else {
        printf("Error parsing factor\n");
    }
    
    printf("Factor value: %d\n", value);

    return value;
}

int term(void) {
    printf("In term\n");
    
    // get the mandatory first factor
    int value = factor();
    token = peek();

    // now handle the optional second term
    // there is still a common left prefix that we can try to simplify with left factoring
    if(token == '*') {
        pop(); // *
        value *= term();       
    } else if(token == '/') {
        pop(); // /
        value /= term();
    } // these are optional in the grammar, so no error if this is not found    

    printf("Term value: %d\n", value);
    
    return value;
}

int expr() {
    printf("In expr\n");
    
    // get the mandatory first term
    int value = term();
    token = peek();

    // now handle the optional second expr
    if(token == '+') {
        pop(); // +
        value += expr();        
    } else if(token == '-') {
        pop(); // -
        value -= expr();
    } // these are optional in the grammar, so no error if this is not found
    
    printf("Expression value: %d\n", value);
    
    return value;
}

int main(void) {
    token = peek();
    int result = expr();
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

Notice the `term` and `expression` nonterminals require left factoring in order to properly implement repeating expressions.  Revise the grammar to factor these common productions, and include your revised grammar with your submission.  Then, modify the example recursive descent parser to call your new nonterminals.

## Part 2: A Calculator Parser with Variable Assignments

Consider our `flex` and `bison` scanner and parser definitions for a calculator grammar:

### calc.l
```
%option noyywrap       

%{
#include <stdio.h>

#define YY_DECL int yylex()

#include "calc.tab.h"

%}

%%

[ \t]	                ; // ignore all whitespace
[0-9]+		        {yylval.ival = atoi(yytext); return T_INT;}
"+"		        {return T_PLUS;}
"-"		        {return T_MINUS;}
"*"		        {return T_MULTIPLY;}
"/"		        {return T_DIVIDE;}
"("		        {return T_LEFT;}
")"		        {return T_RIGHT;}
\n                      {return T_NEWLINE;}

%%
```

### calc.y
```
%{

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern int yylex();
extern int yyparse();
extern FILE* yyin;

void yyerror(const char* s);

%}

%union {
	int ival;
}

%token<ival> T_INT
%token T_PLUS T_MINUS T_MULTIPLY T_DIVIDE T_LEFT T_RIGHT T_NEWLINE

%type<ival> expr term factor
%start calc

%%

calc:                               
    | calc line                     

line: T_NEWLINE  
    | expr T_NEWLINE                { printf("%d\n", $1); } // no return value needed, no type 

expr: term T_PLUS expr              { $$ = $1 + $3; }
    | term T_MINUS expr             { $$ = $1 - $3; }
    | term                          { $$ = $1; }
 
term: factor T_MULTIPLY term        { $$ = $1 * $3; }
    | factor T_DIVIDE term          { $$ = $1 / $3; }
    | factor                        { $$ = $1; }
    
factor: T_INT                       { $$ = $1; }            // just resolve the value!
      | T_LEFT expr T_RIGHT         { $$ = $2; }            // expr will resolve to a value!
      
%%

int main() {
    yyin = stdin;
    
    do {
        yyparse();
    } while(!feof(yyin));
}

void yyerror(const char* s) {
	fprintf(stderr, "Parse error: %s\n", s);
	exit(1);
}
```

First, modify this scanner and parser to support floating point values instead of integer values.  You will modify your numeric token type to include an optional decimal point, and use the `atof` function to convert it to a floating point value.  You will also modify your types union in the parser to be a `float` type instead of an `int`.  Run your calculator with some test inputs to verify that it is working.  Don't forget to change your calls to `printf` to print `%f` instead of `%d`!

Now, we will modify the grammar to support variable assignments.  To do this, we will support new grammar productions that allow storing an expression into a variable defined by an identifier that you can retrieve like a numeric value.  We will also add a type to our types `union` whose type is a `char*` (the name of the identifier variable).  Create a new token called `T_ID` (the name is arbitrary!) whose lexeme is one or more alphabetical characters, and a new token called `T_ASSIGN` that is the lexeme `:=`.  You'll have two new productions: a new `line` of the form `T_ID T_ASSIGN expr line`, and a new `factor` production that resolves to `T_ID`.  The type of the `T_ID` token will be text, so you can set the token type of whichever `union` element you associated with the `char*`.  

In your scanner, you will add a new regular expression for an ID as follows, which returns the `T_ID` type, and copies the name of the variable into yylval.

```c
[a-zA-Z]+               {yylval.text = malloc(strlen(yytext)+1); strncpy(yylval.text, yytext, strlen(yytext)+1); return T_ID;}
```

Correspondingly, add a token into your parser as follows, right where you first defiend the T_INT token.  We'll define this one as text, assuming your union contains a `char* text` in addition to your numeric value.

```c
%token<text> T_ID
```

### Symbol Table

Let's add a symbol table linked list to the header definitions section of your parser file.  This will be a linked list of structures that contain a name, a type, and a value:

```c
struct symbol {
    char* name;
    int type;
    union {
        int ival; // change this to a float to support floats!
    } value;
    struct symbol* next;
};
```

If you encounter the assignment production, print the expression result like before, but now, also assign the value to the symbol table:

```c
struct symbol* sym = putsymbol($1, TYPE_IVAL); 
sym->value.ival = $3; // use fval if you are using float!
```

Your `factor: T_ID` production can retrieve this value from the linked list, and resolve to the value that it finds.  Since our example adds items to the list from the front, the most recent value is always bound to the symbol name.  So, you can return the first instance of the symbol.

This will enable you to execute expressions such as:

```
X := 5
X * 2
```

However, you'll need to support multiple expressions.  You can do this by creating a recursive calculator parser, in which `calc` resolves to `calc` followed by an additional line.  This allows the calculator to parse any number of lines:

```c
calc:                               
    | calc line                     

line: T_NEWLINE  
    | expr T_NEWLINE                { printf("%d\n", $1); } // no return value needed, no type
    | T_ID T_ASSIGN expr line       { }  // your code here to create a symbol whose name is T_ID, and whose value is whatever expr resolves to!
```    

The code to manipulate the linked list (insert and search) is provided for you, and can also be included in the header definitions of your parser file.

```c
const int TYPE_IVAL = 0;
struct symbol* symboltable = NULL;

struct symbol* putsymbol(char* name, int type) {
    struct symbol* sym = (struct symbol *) malloc(sizeof(struct symbol));
    sym->type = type;
    sym->name = malloc(strlen(name)+1);
    strncpy(sym->name, name, strlen(name)+1);

    if(type == TYPE_IVAL) {
        sym->value.ival = 0;
    }
    
    sym->next = symboltable;
    symboltable = sym;
    
    return sym;
}

struct symbol* getsymbol(char* name) {
    struct symbol* p = symboltable;
    struct symbol* result = NULL;
    
    while(p != NULL) {
        if(strcmp(p->name, name) == 0) {
            // only catch the first instance, since newer items are placed in the front of the list
            if(result == NULL) {
                result = p;
            }
            
            break;
        }
        
        p = p->next;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```
