      description: Algorithm Implementation
      preemerging: The algorithm fails on the test inputs due to major issues, or the program fails to compile and/or run
      beginning: The algorithm fails on the test inputs due to one or more minor issues
      progressing: The algorithm is implemented to solve the problem correctly according to given test inputs, but would fail if executed in a general case due to a minor issue or omission in the algorithm design or implementation
      proficient: A reasonable algorithm is implemented to solve the problem which correctly solves the problem according to the given test inputs, and would be reasonably expected to solve the problem in the general case

      description: Code Quality and Documentation
      preemerging: Code commenting and structure are absent, or code structure departs significantly from best practice, and/or the code departs significantly from the style guide
      beginning: Code commenting and structure is limited in ways that reduce the readability of the program, and/or there are minor departures from the style guide
      progressing: Code documentation is present that re-states the explicit code definitions, and/or code is written that mostly adheres to the style guide
      proficient: Code is documented at non-trivial points in a manner that enhances the readability of the program, and code is written according to the style guide

      description: Writeup and Submission
      preemerging: An incomplete submission is provided
      beginning: The program is submitted, but not according to the directions in one or more ways (for example, because it is lacking a readme writeup)
      progressing: The program is submitted according to the directions with a minor omission or correction needed, and with at least superficial responses to the bolded questions throughout
      proficient: The program is submitted according to the directions, including a readme writeup describing the solution, and thoughtful answers to the bolded questions throughout

The purpose of this assignment is to implement, load, and use, a static library (at compile time) in C++, and also to dynamically load functionality from a library (at runtime).

## Part 1: Static Libraries \[[^1]\]
Follow [this tutorial](https://ncona.com/2019/03/building-and-using-a-library-in-cpp/) on creating a library in C++.  In summary, you will create a `.cpp` file with functionality inside, and a `.h` file with your header definition.  

You may choose any library functionality you would like, and references are OK as long as they are cited in your source.  Be creative - what are some functions that you might find useful to have someday (or might find useful to share with someone else)?

## Part 2: Dynamic Library Loading \[[^2]\]
Create a function called `malloc` that accepts an `int size` and returns a `void *`, just like `malloc` does.  In that function, create a pointer `static void*(*mymalloc)(int n)` that you will assign to a call to `dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "malloc")`.  Call `mymalloc(size)` within this function, and store the result in a `void *` variable that your function will return.  Also increment a global variable that you'll store statically within your module.  This call will look like this:

```c
#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <stddef.h>

void* malloc(size_t size) {
    void*(*mymalloc)(size_t) = (void* (*)(size_t)) dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "malloc");
}
```

Next, do the same for `free`, which is a `void` function that accepts a `void *` parameter, as opposed to a function that accepts a `size_t` parameter and returns a `void *` like `malloc` did.  This time, decrement your counter, and print out that variable on each call to your custom `malloc` and `free`.  Test it out with a main() function that calls `malloc` and `free` a few times so you can verify the result.  You should have a count of 0 if you call `free` the same number of times as you call `malloc`!

And, to test, you can write a `main()` function that calls `malloc` and `free`, and compile and run it as usual.  Here is an example:

```c
int main(void) {
    int* x = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int)); 
    *x = 5;
    printf("%d\n", *x);
    free(x);
    // print your counter value, which you can declare as a static int in this module, and increment/decrement in malloc/free
}
```

### Building

If you are using replit, you can click the three dots next to the `Files` list, and choose `Show Hidden Files`.  This will allow you to edit the makefile and enter the compile flags to build these files automatically.  Here is that makefile:

```
all: libs.so main

CC = gcc
override CFLAGS += -ldl

SRCS = $(shell find . -name '.ccls-cache' -type d -prune -o -type f -name '*.c' -print)
HEADERS = $(shell find . -name '.ccls-cache' -type d -prune -o -type f -name '*.h' -print)

main: $(SRCS) $(HEADERS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) "$@.c" -o "$@"

libs.so: $(SRCS) $(HEADERS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(basename $@).c -shared -fpic -o "$@"

clean:
	rm -f main libs.so
```

Otherwise, you can compile the dynamic library and user client program with the following commands, assuming your dynamic library functions are saved in a file called `libs.c` and your main function to test is in a file called `main.c`:

```
gcc -Wall -DRUNTIME -shared -fpic -o libs.so libs.c -ldl
gcc main.c -ldl
```

### Extra Credit (10%): Tracking the Number of Bytes Allocated and Freed
Tracking the number of bytes allocated is relatively easy, since the size of the malloc is provided to the `malloc` function as a parameter.  You could simply add that value to your running total!

The `free` function presents a challenge in that only the address of the free is known to the function, rather than the size of the originally allocated memory at that address.  You could add a linked list or hash table that maps the memory address to the size during `malloc`, and look up that value during `free`.  You could then subtract that amount, and track the actual amount of bytes leaked in your program by failing to free memory.

Add this linked list or hash table and track the number of bytes for extra credit!
